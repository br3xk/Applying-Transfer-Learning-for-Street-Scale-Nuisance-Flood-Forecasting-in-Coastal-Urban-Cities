# Applying-Transfer-Learning-for-Street-Scale-Nuisance-Flood-Forecasting-in-Coastal-Urban-Cities
We apply Transfer Learning for Street-Scale Nuisance Flood Forecasting in Coastal-Urban Cities using an LSTM model. This is implemented in Keras Python.

Input Data: The model's inputs include topographic features, such as the topographic wetness index, depth to water, and elevation, as well as environmental features like hourly rainfall, cumulative rainfall in previous hours, and hourly tide level. The input also includes hourly water depth on streets during storm events generated by the 1-D /2-D coupling hydrodynamic model TUFLOW. The input data is available on Hydroshare (Roy, B., 2025).
